Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project analyzes passenger data from the Titanic disaster and applies machine learning models to predict survival outcomes. The notebook demonstrates key data science practices, including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and building predictive models. It uses the popular Titanic dataset and considers influential features such as age, sex, and passenger class.

Features:

Loads and preprocesses Titanic dataset (Kaggle format)

Handles missing and irrelevant data

Performs EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Trains a logistic regression model to classify survival

Evaluates prediction accuracy on test sets

Technologies:
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

This repository provides a reproducible workflow for beginners and intermediate practitioners looking to explore real-world classification problems with clear and structured Python code.
